# Comparision of attractions
* Comparison of approximately 200 popular attractions in Israel at six different websites: Max, Leumi, Cal, Cuponofesh, Isracard, and American Express.
* This Project was made using Flask and SQL databases codded in Python.
* The project was made to optimize the process of finding discounts for attractions and organize all the information in one place.

## How Does it Work?
* Every day at midnight, Python software is activated which accesses the websites of all the discounts for attractions of the 5 leading credit card companies: Leumi, Max, American Express, Isracard, etc. In addition, to entering Cuponofesh. It collects relevant information about the attraction such as price, points, one plus one, and more.
* The software organizes all the data in one database file. Then it processes the data and turns the list into one ordered list of all the attractions that exist (for example, it needs to determine that the "Museum of the Jewish People" in one company is the same attraction as the "ANU Museum" in a different company.)

## The site today
* Unfortunately, the site's public activity was limited for only several months before closing. This happened as a result of other websites offering comparable comparisons that made my site less competitive. Moreover, the demand of ensuring site activity and regularly updating proved to be almost impossible due to time constraints. 
* The last time the program made an updated list was on 12.6.22 with 198 different attractions.
